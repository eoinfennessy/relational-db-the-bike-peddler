# Relational DB - The Bike Peddler
A relational databases project using MySQL. Includes a DB design document, logical and conceptual ER diagrams, and DDL and DML scripts for defining and querying/manipulating the DB.

This project was created as part of an assignment for SETU's HDip in Computer Science. Students were asked to deliver a database design document consisting of a system description, conceptual data model, and logical mapping, as well as a MySQL implementation of the database design consisting of two SQL scripts that physically define, populate, manipulating, query and control the DB.
